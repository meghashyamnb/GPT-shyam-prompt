Test Execution Summary

The testing for Document Directory Request and Statement Retrieval was performed in the local environment.
Due to downstream dependency services not being available, complete end-to-end validation could not be carried out.

Scope Covered

Verified core business logic locally using unit test cases.

Ensured that the document directory request flow is working as expected for available statements within the supported date range.

Validated basic response structure and statement availability rules at a unit level.

Scope Excluded / Not Covered

Integration testing with downstream systems (service not available).

Performance testing – explicitly out of scope for this release.

Negative & error handling scenarios – not validated in this cycle.

Response to Third Party – Statement Return Rules – excluded from this test run.

Boundary and edge case scenarios (e.g., leap year, invalid ranges, large payloads) – not in scope for this cycle.

Remarks

Testing was limited to unit-level validation due to environment constraints.

Full integration, negative/error handling, and boundary testing will be executed once downstream systems are available.
